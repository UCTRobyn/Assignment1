Description: The program takes the name of each friend in toSearchFor.txt and searches for it in toSearchIn.txt.

The program gives the user the choice between a sequential search and a binary search. The program then prints the name
of every friend in toSearchFor.txt, its position in toSearchIn.txt (-1 if not in toSearchIn.txt), the number of comparisons
that were made before the friend was found/not found in toSearchIn.txt and the time taken to find/not find the friend.
The program also gives the total time taken and total comparisons made to search for every name in toSearchFor.txt.

Instructions: Run Assignment1.java. When prompted enter 'b' for binary search or 's' for sequential search. 



List of files: Assignment1.java, Friend.java, toSearchFor.txt, toSearchIn.txt
